# Vector Ternary Unification (VTU) - Core Simulations

This repository contains the mathematical framework and astrophysical data scrubs 
validating Vector Ternary Unification (VTU). 

## Overview
VTU resolves the **Hubble Tension** and the **Fine-Structure Constant ($\alpha$) Dipole** by modeling the vacuum as an 11-layer torsional logic stack.

## Repository Contents
- `/Data`: Cleaned Quasar absorption spectra and Laniakea Supercluster flow data.
- `/Derivations`: LaTeX source for the VTU foundational paper.
- `/Simulations`: Python/Julia scripts modeling the Universal Z-Axis and the 
  Great Attractor Torsional Eddy.

## Core Findings
- **Z-Axis Orientation:** Calculated at $(\ell, b) \approx (220^\circ, -30^\circ)$.
- **Torsional Drag ($T_q$):** A variable vacuum viscosity that accounts for 
  non-recessional redshift.
